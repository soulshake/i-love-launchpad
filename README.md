# I Love Hue for Launchpad

This was a project for the [Blinkathon](https://magdeboogie.de/event/blinkathon/) hosted by Netz39.

It lets you play a game inspired by the addictive mobile game I Love Hue.

It's quite inefficient and therefore may lag a bit, but it mostly works, and this is about as good as it's going to get.
